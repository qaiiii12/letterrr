                         hi sayangg, i want to tell you how much i love you, how much you mean to me and how much i appreciate
                         you. you are my everything sayangg, you are the reason for all that is good in my world.. i know 
                         sometimes i may act like im not that serious, but let me tell you this, i truly love you and i will always
                         be there for you in good and bad times. Your laugh makes me feel so happy and i feel like our conversations
                         are the most natural and easiest ones ive ever had. you are the one that can makes everything make sense.
                         i cant believe how lucky i was for meeting someone as wonderful and as perfect as you, i dont thinkk there is 
                         one thing about you that i would ever change because everything about you already so amazing. I love you so 
                         muchh sayangg. i love every single aspect of you that makes you who you are and i will never change that fact.
                         Trust mee sayangg, id never leave you. i will try my best to protect this relationship.. my feelings for you
                         will never change and thats guaranteed. so dont overthinking okay? eventho one day we willfind a right man, but 
                         we still can be friends right? dont worry okay? as long as our time is no over yet.. we will spend time together 
                         until we both find the right man.. for now i dont think i will find someone who can treat me like you treat me.
                         no one can make me happy instead of youu sayangg, im sorry for making you feel overthinking.. i really love youu
